# play-python

My Python "play" directory/sandbox.
I keep these around, like a writer might keep around a notepad.
It's nice to push them up to github so that I can sync them across computers.

This should mostly be original code. So the LICENSE, GPL3, applies.
Any submodules should have a LICENSE in their respective directories.
Anything/everything else that doesn't otherwise say so is GPL3.
